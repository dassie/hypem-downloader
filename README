This is a short ruby script that downloads songs from your hypem to 
your local machine. Usage is simple, just run the script with your 
username as a command line argument. Files will be saved to the present
working directory. 

Once the program displays your songs for you you must enter which ones 
you want to download. The format is like so:

"pA-pBsC-sD"

pA-pB - indicates the range of the pages you want to download. Page 2, for
	example would be "p2-p2". Page 1 to 3 would be "p1-p3".

sC-sD - indicates the range of songs on each page that is visited. Note that
	each page will hold 20 songs maximum.

A few examples:
"p3-p3s14-s14" - song 14 on page 3
"p1-p2s1-s20" - all songs from pages 1 and 2
"p1-p8s1-s2 - first and second songs on pages 1 to 8

A previous version had a more flexible selection system but it wasn't really
realistic and I seldom used it.

NOTE: script requires Mechanize
